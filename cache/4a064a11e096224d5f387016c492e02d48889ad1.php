<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Do those sirens always blow?
Or did this time bomb finally explode?
They want you all in cities now
Herded on the coasts
The center cannot hold
And you’ll be armed with nothing but
Your conscience when it goes
If you make it out
You can stay with me</p>

<p>‘Cuz this ain’t the life I’ll leave you, no no
This ain’t the life I’ll leave you, no no
This ain’t the life I’ll leave you, no no
This ain’t the life I’ll leave
Mmm, no no no</p>

<p>Did those shotguns start at dawn?
I could’a slept through Stalingrad
I let the neighbors hunt the land
‘Cuz I know they’re all men of God
The cellar’s stocked for survival
And I’d spend my last days arming for
A war that I wont fight in
There’s a lot that they
Can take from me, yeah</p>

<p>But that ain’t the life I’ll leave you, no no
That ain’t the life I’ll leave you, no no
That ain’t the life I’ll leave you, no no
That ain’t the life I’ll leave
Mmm, no no no
You’re hardly here when you’re home
It’s like you’re living in retreat
Like you see some threat I don’t
But I’m not afraid for my own life
No…</p>

<p>I’m afraid for the life I’ll leave you
I’m afraid for the life I’ll leave you
Mmm, yes yes</p>

<p>‘Cuz you’ll be in your bunker too someday
Yeah, you’ll be in your bunker too someday
Oh yeah, you’ll be in your bunker too someday
Yeah yeah, you’ll be in your bunker too someday
Someday!
Someday!</p>
