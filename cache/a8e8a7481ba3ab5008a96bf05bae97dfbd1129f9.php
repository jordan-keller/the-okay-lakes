<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>I hear the drum of a desperate moth
Caught in the screen and glass
The streetlights reach in through the curtain cloth
Stretching the shadows cast</p>

<p>We pick ourselves from the city’s teeth
Throw some worn-out record on
And each of our breaths is deafening
In the silence between each song</p>

<p>Honey, don’t love me please
I’m not the man I thought I’d be</p>

<p>You say “Sometimes it’s like I’m a guest
‘In hell everything is fine’”
And the words are like stones through a hornet’s nest
“There’s worse things to lose than time”</p>

<p>Honey, don’t: Love me please
I’m not the man that I wanna be</p>

<p>Oh, and days burn down
A pile of ashes
On the ground
And seasons that we
Wait it out
Go passing in a breeze
Days burn down
And all the time you
Swore wont count
It passes in a
Breeze and now
It’s you and i alone</p>

<p>You say “I’d murder the fuckers
I’d wring all their god-damned throats
We’ll never find cover
But the demons aren’t yours alone”</p>

<p>No, no, no, no
No, no, no, mmm</p>

<p>So let ‘em out,
Let ‘em out on me
Let ‘em out”</p>

<p>Another night in our pleasant hell
A swarm starts rising from my chest</p>
