<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's the 42nd parallel
But half of this bar
They talk like they're from somewhere else
With a fake southern drawl
It's like I turned the AM dial
Sliding through to get a beer
I'll stick around a little while
But I don't wanna be long here</p>

<p>They fly the rebel flag in Michigan
They're born with the right
Grandkids of militiamen
Bred for the fight
I hear these villains playing victim
Though they're falling on deaf ears
The same words sounded different
Back when I belonged here
Those same words sounded different
Back when I belonged here</p>

<p>I knew these men as kids
When I was like 'em myself
Righteous with an ignorance
Unknown to itself
But gravity took over
I saw a world beyond this sphere
If it'd pulled me closer
I still might belong here</p>

<p>Instead, I came back every Christmas
Bit my tongue till it bled
Felt my closest grow distant
As their blue blood went red
Felt 'em recognize a stranger
Too far gone to draw in near
Didn't notice I was changing
Till I didn't belong here
Didn't notice I was changing
Till I didn't belong here</p>

<p>Now, I'm drunk under the glimmer
Of a thousand more stars
And they'll go red as they grow dimmer
Till they're lost to the dark
I'll be restless in my searching
As heaven disappears
Man, I used to be so certain
Back when I belonged here</p>

<p>So here's to every nowhere village
To the dark-hidden stars
To the places god no longer visits
Or sends his regards
I left here for a reason
Way back then it wasn't clear
With some distance now I see it
I don't wanna belong here
With some distance now I see it
I don't wanna belong here</p>
