<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Your uncle’s on his shit again
Four fingers of Midleton
Nursing all his lone regrets
Laughing off his eulogy
That all the fools he used to be
And all the men he might have been
Wound up him instead</p>

<p>What will you have when you’re looking back
Once what’s ahead is the distant past
And all of the life that you left to chance
Wastes away?
Wastes away?</p>

<p>Sipping something on the rocks
Spinning on a moonlit dock
Numb as an old bruise
I’m poring over everything
I got regrets ahead of me
But I’m wondering which ones I’ll choose
And which choose me instead</p>

<p>What will I have when I’m looking back?
Once what’s ahead is the distant past
The sum of a life that was left to chance
What will I have?
Man, I don’t know, but</p>

<p>I don’t want to waste away, no
I don’t want to waste away, no
I don’t want to waste away, no
I don’t want to waste away
To waste away anymore</p>
