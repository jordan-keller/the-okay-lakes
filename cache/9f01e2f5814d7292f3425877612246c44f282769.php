<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Let a light down through the clouds
I swore this storm would break by now
It billows and it drums
But nothing ever comes</p>

<p>And my heart is wearing out
Beaten like a cornered mouse
Hoping for a sign
A peace I just can’t find</p>

<p>What if nothing ever comes
And everything is never enough
To raise me from despair
The weight when nothing’s there?</p>

<p>But still I wait my turn
As if mercy might be earned
And weren’t some random pattern
In the sky
And still I sing this prayer
Though I know there’s nothing there
There’s a light I’ve felt
But every time it fell
My chin was tilted down</p>

<p>There must be something here…
There must be something here…
There must be something here…</p>
