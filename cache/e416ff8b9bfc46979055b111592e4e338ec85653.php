<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The ninth drink delivers
The lines you've prewritten
And a voice like yours admits no wrong
I swirl the ice inside my glass
Drowning out the very last words
I should say</p>

<p>I guess that
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell to themselves
Keep it in your head
Careful now, don’t let it wriggle out</p>

<p>One sincere sentence
And six years is ended
Instead my voice sounds strange when I speak to you
How’d we wind up here?
Why do I stay?
Repeat it one last time: "It's just for one more day”</p>

<p>‘Cuz everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand
Everybody’s got a trusty lie they keep to themselves
It sounds right your head
Careful now…</p>

<p>Oh!
If I met you here tonight
For the first time
I’d run the other way
Oh!
That’s a good one!</p>

<p>Everybody’s got a trusty lie they tell to themselves
It’s safe inside your head
So careful now…
Careful now…
Careful now…
Don’t let it…
Wriggle out</p>
